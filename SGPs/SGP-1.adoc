== SGP-1: The Space Governance Proposal Process

*Version 0.1.0*

== What is an SGP?

SGP stands for Space Governance Proposal. An SGP is a document that
details a change to the management, allocation, or use of shared
resources owned or directly influenced by the Space Decentral Network.
All SGPs must be consistent with the goals and values put forth in
link:SGP-0.adoc[SGP-0] (the Space Decentral Manifesto) and compliant
with the requirements outlined in this document, SGP-1. The SGP author
is responsible for building consensus within the community for their
SGP and documenting dissenting opinions.

== SGP process rationale

The purpose of the Space Governance Proposal Process ("the SGP
process") is to provide a structured process for making changes to the
shared resources of the Space Decentral Network. For these shared
resources, governance processes are needed to grant or deny access and
approve or reject proposed changes. By creating a fair, lightweight,
and transparent SGP process, the SGP-1 authors hope to give FTL holders
a meaningful say in the governance of the Space Decentral Association
and the Space Decentral Network and increase the chances of success for
both.

== Proposal workflow

Parties directly involved in the process are the _SGP author_ (you), the
_SGP Editors_, the _Space Decentral Association (“the Association”)_,
and _Space Decentral Network voters_.

Proposals follow this workflow:

* Stage I: Select SGP Track
* Stage II: Pre-proposal
* Stage III: Draft Proposal
* Stage IV: Community Review
* Stage V: Final Proposal
* Stage VI: Space Decentral Network Vote

During Stage III SGP Editors will review proposals for formatting,
legibility, and compliance with SGP-1, referring to SGP-1 as the basis
for accepting, denying, or requesting modifications to a proposal. The
role of SGP Editors is further described in the SGP Editors section.

At a high level, the SGP-1 workflow looks like this:

=== Stage I: Select SGP Track

Before you spend time working on a proposal, make sure the proposal
complies with SGP-1 and has a chance of passing review by the SGP
Editors and your peers. Review the SGP tracks and their requirements
then select the track that you think is best for your proposal. If your
proposal meets the requirements, it has a much greater chance of being
accepted by SGP Editors and approved by Space Decentral Network voters.

There are four tracks that an SGP can be categorized into. Select the
one you think is best for your SGP:

* Association: proposals for making changes to the Association
* Finance: proposals for transferring funds from the Association
multisig
* Meta: proposals for changing SGP-0 or SGP-1 (“changing the way things
are changed”)
* Proclamations: proposals for making a public statement on behalf of
the Space Decentral Network

Proposals that cannot be categorized into one of these tracks will
likely be denied by SGP Editors. At the discretion of SGP Editors, a
proposal may be categorized as “Other” until a new track is approved as
part of a Meta SGP.

In addition to the requirement that all SGPs must be consistent with
SGP-0, each track has its own requirements for SGPs as follows:

*Association* +
Proposals made to the Association track must affect one or more of the
following:

* Association-owned assets, excluding funds held in the Association
multisig
* E.g. “Should the Space trademark be dedicated to the public domain?”
* Association policies
* E.g. “Should the Space Code of Conduct be updated to include a
community-wide ban on Carlos Matos memes?”

*Finance* +
Proposals made to the Finance track must affect the movement of assets
held by the
https://wiki.aragon.org/association/multisigs/overview/[Association
multisig]. The Association will have discretion over which multisig
transfers must go through the SGP process.

* All code and content funded through the SGP process must be released
under one of the following licenses:
* Creative Commons (CC0, CC-BY, CC-SA, CC-BY-SA)
* GPL
* SGPL
* MIT

*Meta* +
Proposals made to the Meta track must affect changes to SGP-0 or SGP-1.
The Association has the power to add and remove SGP Editors and fix
errata in SGP-0 or SGP-1 on an as-needed basis without going through the
SGP process. All other proposals to modify SGP-0 or SGP-1 should be made
to the Meta track. * E.g. “Should the min. acceptance quorum of Space
Decentral Network votes be increased?”

*Proclamations* +
Proposals made to the Proclamations track must be consistent with the
Space Decentral Manifesto. * E.g. “The Space Decentral Network declares
February 10th to be Space Day.”

=== Stage II: Pre-proposal

During Stage II you should seek feedback on your SGP idea by sharing it
with your peers in the Space Decentral community and soliciting their
feedback. Examples of appropriate venues to share your SGP idea include:

* The https://aragon.chat/channel/governance[#governance channel] in
Space Chat
* The https://research.aragon.org/c/community[Community category] in the
Space forum
* The https://github.com/spacedecentral/SGPs/issues[Issues section] of the
https://github.com/spacedecentral/SGPs[SGP repo]

Be open-minded and respectful of all feedback you receive. Adjust your
proposal to address serious concerns as they come up to increase the
odds of your proposal passing review in later stages.

=== Stage III: Draft

After you have asked the Space Decentral community whether an idea has
any chance of support and have received sufficient feedback to feel
confident going forward, you can create a draft SGP as a pull request
to the SGP repo. Use a template from the Templates section below to
ensure you are including all the necessary information. The draft SGP
file should be given a temporary name, which the SGP Editor will rename
when the SGP is assigned a number.

*Templates* +
Below is a list of SGP templates for each track. Copy the template for
the track your SGP is in, fill it out, and submit the pull request with
your SGP for review. Sections marked as “required” in the template must
be completed. Note that all proposals must be licensed CC-0.

* link:../templates/association_template.md[Association]
* link:../templates/finance_template.md[Finance]
* link:../templates/meta_template.md[Meta]
* link:../templates/proclamation_template.md[Proclamations]

To make a Meta track change, you must:

1.  Create and submit a pull request changing either SGP-0 or SGP-1.
2.  In a _separate_ pull request, create a new file in the SGPs folder
of the SGPs repo.
3.  Add a link to the pull request created in step 1 to the new file
created in step 2.
4.  Submit the new file from step 2 as a pull request to the SGPs repo.
This will be the SGP pull request. If the SGP is approved by FTL
holders, the pull request created in step 1 will be merged. If the
proposal is rejected and withdrawn, the pull request created in step 1
will be closed.

=== Stage IV: Community Review

After an SGP has been submitted as a draft to the SGPs repo, it must
undergo a Community Review period that starts three weeks before the
next Space Decentral Network vote begins and lasts for one week. Draft SGPs must
be submitted as a pull request to the SGPs repo before the Community
Review period begins to be considered for the next Space Decentral Network vote.
All draft SGPs that have an open pull request at the time the Community
Review begins will automatically be moved to Stage IV for consideration.

During the Community Review period, the draft SGP author will have a
chance to respond to feedback and make changes to their proposal based
on the feedback they have received to increase the likelihood of the
proposal passing. At the end of the Community Review period, SGP Editors
will perform a final review of the proposal.

* If agreeable, an SGP Editor will assign the SGP a number (generally
the PR number related to the SGP). The SGP Editors will not unreasonably
deny assigning a number to the SGP.
* Reasons for denying an SGP number and closing the pull request include
being too unfocused, too broad, duplication of effort, being technically
unsound, not providing proper motivation or addressing concerns by
reviewers, or not in compliance with SGP-1.

After a proposal in Stage IV has been thoroughly reviewed, you may
finalize your proposal and request that an SGP Editor moves the proposal
from Stage IV to Stage V. If you do not finalize the proposal and
request to move the proposal to Stage V before Stage V is scheduled to
begin, SGP Editors will consider the proposal withdrawn and close the
pull request when Stage V begins.

* If agreeable, the SGP Editor will move the proposal from Stage IV to
Stage V by updating the status in the SGP.
* A request to move the proposal from Stage IV to Stage V will be denied
if material changes are still expected to be made to the draft. No
changes can be made to an SGP while it is in Stage V or VI.

=== Stage V: Final Proposal

An SGP in Stage V is the final version that will appear on the ballot
during the next Space Decentral Network vote. SGPs that move from Stage
IV to Stage V are reviewed by the Space Association Board of Directors
and, if approved during the pre-vote review session, are merged into
the SGPs repo and added to
https://github.com/spacedecentral/SGPs/tree/master/votes[the list] of
SGPs that will be submitted to the Space Decentral Network for a vote
in Stage VI. Approval or rejection of an SGP during Stage V is made at
the discretion of the Association board.

The Stage V Association board review session begins two weeks before
the next Space Decentral Network vote is scheduled to begin and lasts
for one week.

=== Stage VI: Space Decentral Network Vote

All SGPs that have moved to Stage VI since the last Space Decentral
Network vote and have been approved by the Association board are
included on the ballot in the current vote. During the vote, Space
Decentral Network voters will review proposals on the ballot and cast
their votes.

If a vote on an SGP produces a Rejected result, then the status of the
SGP will be updated to "Rejected" and no further action is necessary. If
a vote on an SGP produces an Approved result, then the SGP will either
be executed automatically by the Space Decentral Network or else
dutifully executed by a manager designated in the SGP (or designated by
the Association board if no manager is designated in the SGP). Any pull
requests referenced in a Meta track proposal approved in Stage VI will
be merged by an SGP Editor, and the result of the Space Decentral
Network vote will be recorded in the corresponding SGP file by an SGP
Editor.

== Space Decentral Network Votes

Space Decentral Network votes take place quarterly on the following days,
starting at 16:00 UTC time and lasting for 48 hours:

* Fourth Thursday of January
* Fourth Thursday of April
* Fourth Thursday of July
* Fourth Thursday of October

*Support required* +
With the exception of Meta track proposals, the minimum support required
for approval is >50% of all votes cast, an “absolute majority”. The
minimum acceptance quorum required for approval is >0% (at least one
positive vote needs to be cast). Votes are token-weighted, so 10^-18 FTL
(the smallest possible fraction of one FTL) equals one vote, and at
least 10^-18 FTL is required to vote.

For Meta track proposals, the minimum support required for approval is
>66.6666666666666666% of all votes cast, a “supermajority”. The minimum
acceptance quorum required for approval is >0% (at least one positive
vote needs to be cast). Votes are token-weighted, so 10^-18 FTL (the
smallest possible fraction of one FTL) equals one vote, and at least
10^-18 FTL is required to vote.

*Emergency Vote* +
The Association can call an emergency Space Decentral Network vote or
re-schedule a vote at any time with minimum 48 hours notice by a
unanimous approval vote of the Association board. In case of emergency,
immediately following approval by the board, the Association will make a
best effort to notify FTL holders of the start date and time of the vote
using these communication channels:

* The
https://github.com/spacedecentral/SGPs/tree/master/emergency_votes[Emergency
Votes folder]
* https://aragon.chat/channel/announcements[#announcements channel] in

If the Space Decentral Association approves re-scheduling a vote, the
new start date of the vote must be no more than 14 days later than the
previous start date of the vote. The Space Decentral Association cannot
approve re-scheduling the same vote more than twice.

== SGP Editors

SGP Editors are experienced and active members of the Space Decentral
community selected by the Association to manage the SGP workflow. SGP
Editors are not gatekeepers to the proposal system. SGP Editors exist
to make proposals submitted to the SGP repo easier to review.

SGP Editors have two responsibilities:

* Review proposals
* Move proposals from Stage IV through to Stage V

*Review proposals* +
SGP Editors review proposals and accept, deny, or request modifications
to them based on formatting, legibility, and compliance with SGP-1.

*Move proposals from Stage IV through to Stage V* +
After a proposal author submits a pull request with their proposal in
Stage III and has it reviewed by the community in Stage IV, an SGP
Editor will review the proposal to make sure it is compliant with SGP-1.
If so, the SGP Editor will assign an SGP number to the proposal. After a
proposal in Stage IV has been thoroughly reviewed, the author can
request that an SGP Editor moves the proposal from Stage IV to Stage V.

The current SGP Editors are:

Editors.
